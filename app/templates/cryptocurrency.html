                    Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform established in 2013. Unlike Bitcoin, which focuses mainly on digital payments, Ethereum empowers developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) for diverse purposes, such as finance, gaming, and supply chain management. Smart contracts, which are self-executing programs containing the terms of agreements in code, underpin these applications. Ethereum was the first platform to introduce smart contract functionality. It operates using Ether (ETH), its native cryptocurrency, necessary for executing smart contracts and transactions on the network. Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, can be traded on exchanges and serves as a store of value, akin to Bitcoin. Users of the Ethereum blockchain pay gas fees, denominated in ETH, for transaction validation.

                <h3 class="desc-header">Creator</h3>
                <p class="desc-text">
                    Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer, created Ethereum. At just 19, he recognized the limitations of centralized
                    systems after a frustrating change to his favorite World of Warcraft character. This inspired his vision of a decentralized
                    digital network enabling the development of applications interacting with digital currencies. Before Ethereum, Buterin
                    co-founded Bitcoin Magazine, one of the earliest Bitcoin publications. He published the Ethereum white paper in 2014 and
                    launched the project in 2015, mining the genesis block on July 30, 2015. Buterinâ€™s vision attracted several passionate
                    co-founders, including Gavin Wood, Joseph Lubin, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson. Together, they founded the Ethereum
                    Foundation, a non-profit organization aimed at supporting the platform's development and ecosystem. Notably, only Buterin
                    remains with the project from the original co-founders.
