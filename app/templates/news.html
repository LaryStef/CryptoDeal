            <p>From this point news of CryptoDeal project will appear here. Now Cryptodeal even not in beta version, it supports only three cryptocurrencies. Only three weeks ago there was awful design with many strange color combinations. 70% of site has new design now, that looks not perfect but much better than old one. It was first test news block. I believe there will be a lot of blocks in future.</p>
